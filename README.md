# lp-cell-app
This is a deployed progressive web application that we post, put data to API and in some routes we are getting data an delete. 
Deploy folder's name is dist but if you try to open deployed app in a web page it won't work because of router. It will give cors problem.
Therefore you can disable web security or use the command in the last line.
